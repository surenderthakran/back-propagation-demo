# Back Propagation Neural Network Demonstration

A simple Go program to demonstrate back propagation in a neural network to
approximate an AND gate using back propagation technique.
The neural network in the program has one input, hidden and output layer each.

To run the program simply clone the repository and run:
```
go build
./back-propagation-demo
```
or you can simply run:
```
go run *.go
```

For a detailed description to understand the math behind the program, visit my
